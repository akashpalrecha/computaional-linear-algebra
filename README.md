# Computational Linear Algebra by Fast.ai

> This project contains my work on [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)'s [Computational Linear Algebra Course](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra) along with my own explorations of the subject.<br>


This is a work in progress. This website be updated as and when I make more progress towards the course.
